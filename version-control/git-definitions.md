# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful? : Version control is a way to record changes to a file (or files) over a length of time. It is useful because it allows you to track changes, review changes, and  rollback to previous versions. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one? : A branch is essentially a copy of the project. It allows you to make changes, without impacting the master branch. Branches can be created as needed and merged back to the master branch independently. It preserves the working condition of the master. You would a branch any time you are adding or changing your project so that you maintain its integrity as you work on it. It is particularly useful when working in a team.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? : A commit is a save point. A good commit message specifically explains what was done in the commit (what was changed/added/etc).

* What is a merge conflict? : A merge conflict is at it's essence when changes on branches conflict with each other (not including the master branch). For example, Branch-A and Branch-B are being worked on and both have the opening line changed. A merge conflict will arise since it does not know which to keep/has precedence.
