// create function that takes a word as a parameter
  // within function, create a variable that will hold the letters as they come back from the loop
  // loop through each letter of word backwards
    // store each letter in new variable
  // close loop
  // print new variable (which contains all letters of original word, but in reverse order)
// close function
