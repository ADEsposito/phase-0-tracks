# Resources to Look At
  * YouTube videos
  * JQuery text book (skim)
  * JQuery cheatsheets (bookmark after skimming)
  * JQuery docs

# How Often to Stop and Review/Test Self
  * I find that I can work for about 45min - 1hr before I need a "brain break"; however, I think I will aim for taking a 10 min test break every 30 min which will give me the option to go for another 10-15min if I'm in the middle of something, rather than break awkwardly.

# Breaks Important?
  * I think breaks will be important in testing my understanding, drilling in skills/syntax/etc, and for preventing brain fatigue.

# How to Approach JQuery
  * I tend to learn best by watching examples/tutorials and then secondarily, by reading, so I plan to incorporate those two methods heavily.
  * First I plan on scanning some cheatsheets to get an idea of what JQuery is capable of
  * Then I plan to skim the docs
  * Next I plan to watch some YouTube videos and practice skills
  * After a break, I plan to look through my JQuery book and then practice a bit more.

# Most Effective methods
  * I found that watching a couple of tutorials helped me wrap my brain around topics that I had skimmed over/familiarized myself with a bit
  * I found that reading the JQuery book didn't help me as much since it wasn't very tangible
  * The most beneficial to me was just playing around, testing things out
